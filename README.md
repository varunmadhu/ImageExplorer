**Android app for Image Management**

**Overview**
This Android application is an image management project, that allows users to manage and organize their photo albums on their personal smartphones. The app is designed for a single user, the owner of the phone, and does not require any login or admin functionality. Explicit captions for photos are not mandatory, and dates are optional.

**Features**

**Home Screen**
When the app starts, it loads album and photo data from the previous session (if any) and displays a list of all albums with names in plain text.

**Album Management**
Open, create, delete, and rename albums as per the Java FX project description.
Display all photos within an open album with their thumbnail images.

**Photo Management**
Add, remove, or display a photo within an open album.
Implement a slideshow feature with manual controls to navigate backward or forward in the album one photo at a time.

Delete a tag from a photo.
Tags should be visible when displaying a photo.

**Photo Movement**
Move a photo from one album to another.
